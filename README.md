In the early days of computing, machines like these were thought to be the future of technology, however this may not have turned out to be the case.

__Caption__: The original caption of this graphic read, _Scientists from the RAND
Corporation have created this model to illustrate how a "home computer" could
look in the year 2004. However, the needed technology will not be economically
feasible for the average home. Also the scientists readily admit that the computer
will require not yet invented technology to actually work, but 50 years
from now scientific progress is expected to solve these problems.
With teletype interface and the Fortran language, the computer
will be easy to use.

## Motivation

In Bioinformatics research, finding a useful tool to handle an aspect
of the research project may take time. Here, the researcher may have
to read through the specifications of many tools to be able to find
the one that will fit the job. Most tools tend to look perfect for
seemingly any task, however, the researcher should be ready to look
again to determine whether the tool and the task are really
completely compatible ...

## Instructions

You are to visit one of the above resources in which tools and resources are provided. Choose a resource to play with to learn how it works. Then, spend some time to write about this tool using the document, `writing/reflection.md` in your working repository.  

## Working in Your Repository

As you are working on your assignment, you are to commit and push regularly. The commands are the following.

```
git add -A
git commit -m ``Your notes about the commit here''
git push
```

After you have pushed your work to your repository, please visit the repository at the GitHub website (you may have to log-in using your browser) to verify that your files were correctly sent.

### Deliverable

Please complete the sections of the File: `writing/reflection.md`

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

## Assessment

This grade is a check mark.
